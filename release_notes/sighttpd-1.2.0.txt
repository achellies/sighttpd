sighttpd 1.2.0
==============

Sighttpd is an HTTP streaming server designed for distributing realtime
input. It is particularly useful for making camera streams available to
multiple clients, and has been designed for embedded systems use.

This release is available as a source tarball from:

        http://www.kfish.org/software/sighttpd/

New in this release
===================

Dependencies to libshcodecs, libshveu, and libuiomux have been removed.
The streaming video is done with shcodecs-record found in libshcodecs.

Please make sure that shcodecs-record is in search path, i.e. the directory
where shcodecs-record can be found must be in an environment variable PATH.

Sighttpd creates named pipes to retrieve stream generated by shcodecs-record.
You may specifiy any control file as encoding parameters. Sighttpd overrides
'output_directry' and 'output_stream_file', so that shcodecs-record properly
streams into the named pipes created.
